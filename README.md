# Weather Application
### The app displays the medium temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature, also you can see the wind speed and an icon shows weather status (cloudy, sunny, windy ). I used function ‘useEffect’ to get the API data, ‘await’ for waiting to receive the data and ‘async’ for run and props, ‘useState’ for comuncation.
