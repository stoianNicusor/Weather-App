# Weather Application
### The app displays the medium temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature, also you can see the wind speed and an icon shows weather status (cloudy, sunny, windy ). I used function useEffect to get the API data, await for waiting to receive the data and async for run and props, useState for comuncation.
